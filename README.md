## Refactor codebase to meet accessibility standards and improve SEO.



In an effort to learn, understand, and implement HTML and CSS structure, elements and properties I have refactored the code to maximize the website's accessibility, thus enhancing the search engine optimization. 

- Added symantec HTML elements
- Included "alt" descriptions to image elements.
- Edited position elements in CSS to match desired layout.
